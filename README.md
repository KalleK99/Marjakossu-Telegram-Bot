Marjakossu-Telegram-Bot

This is a simple Telegram bot which keeps a leaderboard for a telegram group chat. In the group chat, people can hold so-called "Marjakossu meetings",
each of which is organized by a chair, or "Pj". The purpose of the bot is to track how often each person has organized a meeting and produce a leaderboard
showing the 10 most active meeting organizers.

The bot is written in Python and uses a MySQL database to store information. The bot and its database are currently only hosted on my PC, although in the future
this could change if I find a suitable server
